# 1.Convert to Lowercase
# Write a Python program that takes a string input from the user and converts it to lowercase?
# a="WELCOMETOALL"
# b=a.lower()
# print(b)

# 2.Convert to Uppercase
# Create a program that takes a string input from the user and converts it to uppercase.
# a="welcometoall"
# b=a.upper()
# print(b)

# 3.Capitalize the First Letter
# Write a program that capitalizes only the first letter of a string while keeping the rest of the letters in lowercase.
# a="welcometoall"
# b=a.capitalize()
# print(b)

# 4.Count Occurrences of a Character
# Given a string, ask the user to input a character and print how many times that character appears in the string.
# a="synnefo"
# b=a.count("n")
# print(b)

# 6.Check if a String Starts with a Substring
# Ask the user for a string and a substring. Write a program to check if the string starts with that substring.
# a=(input("enter a character:"))
# b=(input("enter another character:"))
# x = a.startswith(b)
# print(x)

# 7.Check if a String Ends with a Substring
# Write a Python program that checks if a given string ends with a specific substring provided by the user.
# a=input("enter a value:")
# b=input("enter another value:")
# x = a.endswith(b)
# print(x)

# 8.Remove Whitespace
# # Create a program that removes any leading and trailing spaces from a string provided by the user.-----------------------------
# a="synnefo is in kochi 123"
# c=a.split()
# print(c)


# 9.Replace a Word
# Write a Python program that takes a string and asks the user for a word to replace, then replaces that word with a new one in the string.
# a=input("enter a word:")
# b=input("enter another word:")
# x = a.replace(a,b)
# print(x)

# 10.Split a String into Words
# Write a Python program that splits a string into a list of words based on spaces.
# a=input("enter a sentence:")
# c=a.split()
# print(c)

# 11.Join Words into a String
# Given a list of words, write a program that joins them into a single string, with a space between each word.
